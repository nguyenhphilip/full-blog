      <description>Arbiter of cessation, master of endings, a gust inevitably endured. Clench your jaw now, the exchange is complete: Snow and frost for people and sidewalks. Inches and burdens for sauntered footfalls.
There is a season between seasons a bridge that is crossed by the plentiful few. Adults and scientists seek it endlessly though only the children know of its whereabouts. But don’t bother with asking–– they’re sworn to the promises of secrecy.</description>

      <description>Feelings are fleeting by nature, like the passage of clouds on a warm summer day.
Though too often we wear them like immutable masks and declare, &amp;ldquo;This is me. This is all I will ever be.&amp;rdquo; Sad. Resentful. Despondent. Happy. In truth they are masks, transient facades that hide a more true and vulnerable sense of self.
We put these masks on when we&amp;rsquo;re scared, when we&amp;rsquo;re too afraid to ask for attention and love; when we&amp;rsquo;re on the verge of breaking, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to ask for help.</description>

      <description>Dear stranger, I know we’ve just met but, I love you.
I love you more than you could know. I love you unconditionally. I love you.
I cannot know your pain, your experience, Your suffering. That is all yours. But you do not have to bear it alone.
Dance with melancholy And sing out your blues but please Don&amp;rsquo;t stop.
Talk to me. Tell me about it. Whatever you feel, feel it.</description>
