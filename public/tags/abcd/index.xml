      <description>This is the abstract I submitted to OHBM 2020 for the ABCD Brain Analysis Tool. The GUI was built under the guidance of the great Bader Chaarani. We thought about naming it something punny after Bader - i.e. The ABCD BAD Tool - but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything appropriate for submission.
Anyways, here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
 Introduction:
  Given the computational and analytical expertise required to study large MRI datasets such as that generated by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we created the ABCD Brain Analysis Tool (BAT) to allow researchers from various academic backgrounds to utilize fMRI data in their research.</description>

      <description>Examining the relationship between prematurity, mental health, and neurocognition in ABCD. Ran some T-tests and created visualizations.
This is an interactive HTML page using R Markdown for an analysis I did for my PI. Source code here; GIF demonstrating below.

      <description>A searchable data dictionary and ABCD release notes all in one place. Much easier to navigate compared to NDA&amp;rsquo;s data dictionary.
Unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t show the app&amp;rsquo;s source code due to confidentiality, but this is a GIF demonstrating what it does.
  Built using R and Shiny. Data pulled from NDA website.</description>

      <description>ABCD Data Downloader: an app I built in Shiny to help ABCD Researchers download ABCD data sets (Unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t show the app due to confidentiality, but the source code is here.)
Here is a GIF demonstrating some of the app&amp;rsquo;s functionality.
You can select which spreadsheet(s) you want to download, specific variables from the spreadsheets, which visits to include, and what to name your file.
  Developed with R and Shiny.</description>
