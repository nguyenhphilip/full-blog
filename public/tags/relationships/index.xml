      <description>Between every relationship we ever had, have, and will have, there exists a unique configuration of constellations that defines its being. For some it radiates and burns with the intensity of a sun. Let it grow and we risk hurting ourselves, hurting others, discovering truths that we aren&amp;rsquo;t yet ready to witness; yet left unkindled and we might just miss the very thing that gives life its color. Most of us tread cautiously.</description>
