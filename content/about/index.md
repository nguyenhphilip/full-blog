Musings on Life and Living. Sometimes work is involved.

## What I'm Doing Now

* Learning Python
* Learning guitar
* Thinking about learning Russian or French (+1 vote for Russian bc I have a Russian friend but no French ones)
* Deepening my R knowledge
* Improving my statistical thinking
* Doing data science projects for my portfolio

## Longer Version

Currently I help run the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org) in Vermont, the largest and longest longitudinal study of adolescent brain development in the U.S. I run subjects, schedule visits, and manage our part-time staff. I am also, after a brief dive into [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [the Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) (thank you professor Weaver!), the resident data wrangler, amateur Shiny developer, and rookie researcher in training. 

Some kind words related to R wizardry:

> "Dude you are soooo good at this. Wtf." -Amanda, Neuroscience PhD candidate <br><br>

> "Yeah, he practically coded my whole master's thesis." -Zoe, Master's student in Pharmacology<br><br>

> "You really like this programming shit don't you." -Alexi, ABCD PI<br><br>

Prior I worked in a mental health and addiction treatment center, a Title I elementary school in New Hampshire, and an 8-week overnight summer camp in Maine.

Books, people, playing outside, and learning bring me joy.

I am a California native turned New England enthusiast.

I once walked across Spain and [wrote about it](https://philintheblank.me/tags/camino-de-santiago/).
